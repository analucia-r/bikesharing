Where it's shaded darker shows the time of day and weekday mostly used. Filtered by gender where Males seems to be the most frequent users and the type of Usertype which makes sense to have both options available prices may vary. 

## Summary
The data demonstrates August being the most popular month in NYC for bike sharing activities. It seems to be more requested and used in Manhattan Island area by Males. Also that data shows that peak hours are usually during the morning and evening rush hours. I conclude that the users of City Bikes most be people that work in the city the 9-5 jobs.
